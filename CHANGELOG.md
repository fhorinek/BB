Please break me!

There is a new system to record device state in case of Hard Fault.
New file crash_report.zip will be created when the device crash.

The file contains snapshot of the STM memory, debug.log, listing of files on sdcard and whole config folder, excluding wifi credentials.

Please include whole zip file, when reporting an issue.
